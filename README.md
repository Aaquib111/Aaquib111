- ðŸ¤— Name: Aaquib Syed
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m looking to solve real world issues using technology. 
  - Currently, I am working on a paper with the Montefiore-Einstein Radiology Lab in NYC on predicting breast cancer chemotherapy response using AI to maximize survival rates and     save lives. The paper is pending publishment. I hope to one day have my research be used clinically, potentially saving hundreds of thousands of lives annually!
  - In addition to my research on cancer, I also love using technology to solve accessibility issues. Check out my work on creating a [personal-distance-monitor](https://github.com/Aaquib111/personal-distance-monitor) to help individuals with autism spectrum disorder with learning social distancing, and my work on [creating a device to manage the stress levels](https://github.com/Aaquib111/asd-stress-level-management) of students with autism spectrum disorder!
<!--- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more on deep learning using CNNs to web design using React and Djag-->

- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for more opportunities to utilize my skills to bring technologies to life!

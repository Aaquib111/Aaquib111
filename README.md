- ðŸ”­ Hi! I like thinking about and solving problems in AI/ML and finance---my current interest is in creating scalable methods to attribute and edit behaviors and knowledge in large language models. I also love competitive programming, working with low-level languages, and creating infrastructure and trading strategies for financial markets.

- ðŸ¥£ For now, you'll find me vehemently tinkering with my AI models and inevitably breaking something (in a separate git branch of course), writing research papers, and trying to optimize the milk-to-cereal ratio for my breakfast.
<!--- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more on deep learning using CNNs to web design using React and Djag-->

- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for more opportunities to utilize my skills to bring technologies to life!

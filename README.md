- ðŸ¤— Name: Aaquib Syed
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m looking to solve real world issues using technology. 
  - Currently, I am working on a paper with the Montefiore-Einstein Radiology Lab in NYC on predicting breast cancer chemotherapy response using AI to maximize survival rates and     save lives. The paper is pending publishment.
  - I am also working on classifying tumor origin in patients with Carcinoma of Unknown Primary (metastasized cancer with unknown origin) to hasten time to devise a cancer             treatment.
  - I hope to, one day, have these technologies be used clinically, potentially saving hundreds of thousands of lives annually!
  - In addition to my research on cancer, I also love using technology to solve accessibility issues. Check out my GitHub repos on my work in creating technologies for individuals     with autism spectrum disorder (ASD)!
<!--- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more on deep learning using CNNs to web design using React and Djag-->

- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for more opportunities to utilize my skills to bring technologies to life!
